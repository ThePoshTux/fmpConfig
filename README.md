Configuration file builder for the Minecraft mod Forge Multipart.
A configuration file "microblocks.cfg" is required by Forge Multipart to whitelist blocks to be used as microblocks.

This project provides several mod support modules with the .txt extension.
To remove modules for mods you don't have, either delete the file for that mod or change the extension.
Run the bat file or .sh file depending upon your system.
copy the resultant microblocks.cfg to your games config folder
