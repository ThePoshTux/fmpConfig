# fmpConfig
Configuration file builder for the Minecraft mod Forge Multipart.
A configuration file "microblocks.cfg" is required by Forge Multipart to whitelist blocks to be used as microblocks.

# How to create config
Download as zip or open with github desktop application
If in zip form extract files into empty folder.
This project provides several mod support modules with the .txt extension.
To remove modules for mods you don't have, move the modules to the provided disabled folder. This allows for easily reenabling modules.
Run the bat file or .sh file depending upon your system.
copy the resultant microblocks.cfg to your games config folder

# tips for colaborators
At the begining of your module use #modname to make the module easily searchable in the combined config.
Leave a new line at the end of your modules otherwise the line of the next module will be merged with your last line.
